# Animals Gallery

Final project for the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design) online course by _University of London, Goldsmiths, University of London_ on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

[Certificate earned](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Y9Y64XDBS5MU) in August 2016.

## Brief

One-page application. Collection of animals grouped by categories (mammals, reptiles, birds). All the data are taken from JS object.

## Technologies used:

- Bootstrap styles and grid layout
- JavaScript & jQuery
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) JS templating library

## Features
- one-page approach is implemented via JS templating and onclick event listeners
- user-friendly nav: whatever page a user visits, he/she has definite signs of _where I am?_ and _where can I go?_ (e.g., current animals category is highlighted in navigation and printed in heading)
- all images in categories are clickable and behave like "Read more..." links
- on home page: "hero of the day" (some animal); both category and the animal are chosen randomly on each page reload
- a simple slideshow is implemented inside "hero of the day" area: images change on click
- site is fully responsive
